A developer portfolio I'm building for myself using Angular and Sass. Some of it might be a bit superfluous, but I want to show various aspects of my ability to create interesting components and express my own style as well.

If you'd like to download it and use it, have at it. Shouldn't be too hard to make it your own. Thanks for reading! Please let me know if you have any suggestions or find bugs. ðŸ˜ƒ
