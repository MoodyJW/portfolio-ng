      <p>
        The first time I wrote code was sometime in the late 90s when I
        customized my AOL 3.0 profile. After that, I took a break from coding
        for a while and finished high school, spent four years in the US Army,
        bartended, sold cars, tutored writing, got a degree in psychology, and
        worked as tech support for an insurance company.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        In early 2019 I decided I wanted to learn Python and become a
        programmer. I struggled; however, I became obsessed with coding. I'd
        never understood what it was like to get such a sense of satisfaction
        from something I could be paid to do.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        I quit my insurance job and started coding. Day after day and hour after
        hour, I beat my brain against the wall that is learning such a complex
        new skill. Fast-forward a few months and I enrolled in a coding
        bootcamp. With the help of an instructor and classmates, I started to
        see serious progress and began learning JavaScript along with Python.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Before the bootcamp ended in November 2019, I had a contract-to-hire
        position lined up with an oil and gas company in Houston, TX. They
        wanted me to work on refactoring a massive legacy application into a
        modern, responsive Angular application. I was ecstatic and terrified,
        I'd never touched Angular before that interview, which I explained in
        the interview, yet they still hired me.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        After six months, the company offered me a full-time position and I've
        been here for about two years now. Sometimes I wonder where I'd be if I
        spent that 20 year break coding instead; nevertheless, I believe my
        experiences leading up to this point are what provides me with a deep
        appreciation for being able to do something I love and still pay rent.
